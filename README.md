## Description

This project involves building an API for a social network web application using Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose. The API allows users to share their thoughts, react to others' thoughts, and manage a friend list. The application includes routes for creating, updating, and deleting users and thoughts, as well as adding and removing reactions and friends. The API is tested with Insomnia to ensure all POST, PUT, and DELETE routes function correctly. The project also includes a walkthrough video demonstrating the functionality of the API.
